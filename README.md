# SimpleHTTPSServer
A simple python http and https webserver

# Disclaimer
This was something I wrote when I was learning Python and should not be used
for anything other than an a learning example. If you wish to use it then look at
how it is used in SimpleHTTPSServer/__main__.py also its only python 2.7
compatable if I remeber right.
